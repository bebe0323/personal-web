- select a class of models and loss function
- fit a model to training data
- use a model to predict data that is not in training set

Class of functions
$$Y=f(X,\theta)$$
- $X$ input data
- $\theta$ parameters

A loss function
$$l(Y,\hat{Y})$$
- Y known output values form data
- $\hat{Y}$ estimated output value using $f$

>empirical risk: an average of the loss on such dataset (training dataset)

> ERM: minimizing empirical risk is good if we want to minimize loss on data *not* used in training
