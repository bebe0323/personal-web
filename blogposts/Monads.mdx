### Binds

Custom bind implementation for Maybe type. Bind function takes two arguments:
1. Maybe a
2. (a -> Maybe b)

By using bind, we can pass the argument to the function without having to worry about the type (a -> Maybe b). If it is Nothing, bind function will not call the function.

```Haskell
bindM :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
bindM Nothing _ = Nothing
bindM (Just x) k = k x

-- lambda function: takes arguments followed by a expression
-- \param1 param2 ... paramN -> expression

secrets :: [(Int,String)]
secrets =
[(0,"has a crush on their spinning instructor!"),
(1,"is italian but secretly loves pineapple on pizza!")]

idTable :: [(String,Int)]
idTable =
[("Bertram",0),
("Agatha",1),
("Leif",2)]

-- lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
getSecret' e =
	lookup e idTable `bindM` \id ->
	lookup id secrets `bindM` \secret ->
	Just $ "OMG " ++ e ++ " " ++ secret ++ "!"

-- lookup e idTable    - returns (Maybe Int)
-- 2nd argument of bindM: \id -> lookup id secrets (a -> Maybe b)
-- if lookup e idTable returns Nothing, bindM function will return nothing
	-- otherwise, it will do (\id -> lookup id secrets)
-- if there is Nothing after any operation, `bindM` simply not execute the function
```


### Kinds
```
Term layer: 1, True, ["hello", "world"]
Type layer: Bool, Maybe a, (->)
Intuitively: kinds are to types, as types are to terms
In the same way as all terms have a type,
	all types have a kind.

* is the kind that assigned to all types that are inhabited
"Inhabited" - contain values

Bool    :: *
[[Int]] :: *
[Int]   :: *


Arrow types are for type constructors

Maybe Int :: *
Maybe     :: * -> *
^ Maybe is a type constructor, given a type Int, it will return Maybe Int
If we give Maye an argument that has kind *, we get a type of kind *.
``` 


### Functors
```haskell
class Functor f where
	fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- :info Functor gives all the types
```
Unary type constructor: takes one type as an argument and produces a new type.
A functor is a unary type constructor equipped with a map function
```haskell
maybeMap :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
maybeMap f Nothing = Nothing
maybeMap f (Just x) = Just $ f x
```

- Because a functor is a unary type, it can be applied to Maybe or List.
	- map function applies the function to List, map is an instance of functor
	- :t map
		- `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`
	- :t fmap
		- `fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`

```
map succ [1,2,3]     -> [2,3,4]
fmap succ [1,2,3]    -> [2,3,4]
fmap succ (Just 3)   -> (Just 4)
```

There are two functor laws
1. `fmap id x  = x` identity
2. `fmap f (fmap g x) = fmap (f . g) x` composition

### Data & Type Constructor
`data Thing a = Thing a a`
- Left side: Type constructor
- Right side: Data constructor
```haskell
thingInt :: Thing Int
thingInt = Thing 3 4
```
### Monads

```haskell
class Monad m where
	return :: a -> m a
	(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```
Here, in return function, type `m` can be thought as a container that wraps value a.


### Kleisli Arrows
```
(>>=)  :: m a      ->  (a -> m b)       ->  m b
		 ^monad        ^Kleisli arrow       ^monad

revApp :: a         ->  (a -> b)    -> b
		  ^value        ^funciton      ^value

*Kleisli composition*
(.) :: (b -> c)      -> (a -> b)     -> (a -> c)
        ^function        ^function       ^function

(<=<) :: (b -> m c) -> (a -> m b) -> (a -> m c)
          ^Kleisli      ^Kleisli      ^Kleisli
```

```haskell
revApp :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
revApp x f = f x
```


### Do notation
```haskell
use :: State Integer Integer
use =
  get         >>= \x ->
  put (x + 1) >>= \_ ->
  return x

-- using do notation
use :: State Integer Integer
use = do
  x <- get     -- if we want to store the value
  put (x + 1)
  return x
```

```haskell
-- another example

safeDivide :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing
safeDivide x y = Just (x `div` y)

calc :: Maybe Int
calc = safeDivide 10 2 >>= \x ->
	   safeDivide x 2 >>= \y ->
	   return (y + 1)

doCalc :: Maybe Int
doCalc = do
	x <- safeDivide 10 2
	y <- safeDivide x 2
	return (y + 1)
```
`<-`: Extracts the result from a monadic action.

### List Monad
Because list is a instance of Monad, we need to define *return* & *bind*.

```haskell
returnL :: a -> [a]
returnL a = [a]

bindL :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
bindL l f = concat $ map f l
```

```
ghci> bindL [1, 10, 100] (\x -> [x - 1, x + 1])
[0,2,9,11,99,101]

(standard Monad)
ghci> [1, 10, 100] >>= (\x -> [x - 1, x + 1])
[0,2,9,11,99,101]
```
