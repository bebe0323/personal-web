LAN: Local area networks
Initially, in 50s and 60s, organizations started using networks to transfer data.
Lan could be only 2 computers or an university campus with thousands of computers.
The most famous and successful LAN technology: ethernet.
- developed in 1970s
- Computers are connected to single common ethernet cable
	- computer writes data as an electrical signal
- Since the cable is shared, every computer can access the data.
	- the computer couldn't know whether the data is intended for them.
- Ethernet requires each computer to have a Media Access Control Address (MAC address)
- the computer process the data only when the header contains their MAC address
- Bandwidth: the rate of transmitting the data
- the cable can not transmit multiple electrical signal at the same time
	- so, when the cable is used, the computer waits for a brief time to check if the cable is used
	- wait duration is random to prevent collisions



# Switch
To prevent collision, we can reduce the number of computers that connected to single common ethernet cable. For example, instead of 6 computers connected to the same cable, 3 connected to the same and another 3 connected to the same cable. These two cable connected by switch.
# Routing
By using multiple switches, we can transmit data from one computer to another by multiple ways.
# circuit switching
	to connect two computers, they wait the whole circuit to route traffic to correct destination
	This method is expensive and unefficient as there is often unused capacity.
	Banks and military still buys circuits as they don't have to share with others.
# Message switching
When data is transmitted, it passes through multiple stops.
