# Two main roles of OS
1. OS is an abstract machine
	- provides high-level abstractions
	- extends basic hardware with added functionality
	- it hides an details of the hardware
		- make application code portable
		- don't have to write code for specific hardware structure
2. OS is a **resource manager**
	- allocating resources to users and processes
	- must ensure
		- no starvation
		- progress
		- allocate via some desired policy
		- overall, the system is efficiently used

# Operating System Kernel
- Part of the OS that runs in *privileged mode*
- contains fundamental functionality
- contains mode-frequently used functions

# OS is privileged
- prevent applications from interfering with each other
- OS can enforce its resource allocation

# Privilege-less OS
- Some embedded OS have no privileged mode
	- it can implement OS functionality, but cannot enforce it
		- All software runs together
		- No isolation
		- one fault might brings down entire system

# System Libraries
- System libraries are just libraries of support functions
- Subset of Library functions are actually system calls
	- strcmp(), memcpy() are pure library functions
		- manipulating memory within application
	- open(), close(), read(), write() are system calls
		- crossing the user-kernel boundary (to read from disk)
		- implementation mainly focused on passing request to OS and returning result to application
		- ```man syscalls```
